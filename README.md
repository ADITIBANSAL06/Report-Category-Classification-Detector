ðŸ“Š Report Category Classification using Machine Learning

This project classifies user queries into one of four categories:

Career / Job

Health / Wellness
Finance / Money

It was developed as part of an internship task to demonstrate skills in dataset creation, text preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

Project Overview

* Dataset: 800 synthetic queries (200 per category).

* Preprocessing: Lowercasing, stopword removal, TF-IDF vectorization.

* Models Trained:
    Logistic Regression
    Multinomial Naive Bayes

* Evaluation Metrics: 
    Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix.

* Deployment:

    Flask API (app.py) for backend predictions.

    Streamlit app (streamlit_app.py) for a simple interactive UI.
